                <h1>About Jim</h1>
                <strong><small>My name is Jim Turner. I live in sunny Ponte Vedra Beach Florida with my wife Sherry and our son Cade. We have 5 kids between us starting with the oldest Logan, Chelsea, Shelby, Jillian and Cade. I am blessed to live in such a great community with one the highest rated school districts in the nation. I enjoy working out, biking, rucking and all of it on the beach or just outside as much as possible. I have a BS degree in Exercise Physiology from Southeast Missouri State University.
                    I began my career as a strength coach immediately following graduation in 1997. I wasn't full time until 2005 when I first moved to Jacksonville. I love what I do, but in light of everything that's happened in this crazy world, I decided to branch out and learn something new in hopes of a career change(I'm not getting any younger). I have worked previously on my business website and had to learn
                    some coding in the process. It has alwasy been something I love to do and Coding Temple was the best program I could find, with great reviews and once I talked to Todd Schreiber in admissions, I was sold! Todd made me feel at home and helped me feel welcomed and was always available and I mean always. I am excited to start this new journey and ready to kick off a new career!!

                <h1>Path To Success</h1>
                <strong><small>Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and copy it. - Bruce Lee</small></strong>

                </figure>
                <p>I was not the best student in high school and didn't really wake up until college when I was on my own and had to figure it out or flunk out. I believe it is my faith that has brought me thru so many tough times. I was adopted 3 months before I was born by the best parents one could have. Now that they are both gone, its the rest of my family that drives me and my desire to provide a good life with my wife for all of us. 
                    I found myself to be a good leader wherever I went. I was a football, basketball and baseball coach for years and stil coach football today. I believe its my willingness to allow kids to be who they are and put them in the best position to be successful that has helped me grow not only as a coach but as a husband and father. I worked in security for a few years as coordinator over 6 campuses for my church. A challenge that 
                    helped me grow even more in the area of communication. It is what I do on a daily basis now when training my clients and teaching them about health and fitness. How to take care of their bodies before and after fitness or sport. I have trained MMA fighters, Pro basketball players, numerous men and women entering the mlitary as well as, police and fire departments in the local area. I feel that my desire to be the best I can be
                    and a hunger to learn new skills is whats attracted me to web development. I love the challenge but it is so much fun at the same time. I have a stead fast resolve, I am highly motivated and loyal to a fault. I am ready to grow, learn and develop into a talented and valuable asset when it comes to the field of software engineering.
